	<h3 class="title2">Our Story</h3>
	<p class="description">Tanaka Guitar began in the year 1975 with the goal of providing the best quality of guitar for our customers. Our founder, Matsuhito Tanaka, got the idea of opening a guitar shop after he struggled to find a guitar in his hometown of Makassar. He and his band member were understandably very frustrated with this situation. They then decided to fix the situation themselves and joinedly open Tanaka Guitar. Eventually the members split up and left the Tanaka Guitar to Tanaka, the guitarist in 1979. Now, we has grown and become the No.1 guitar store by items sold in Indonesia. With 12 branches all over the country, we are ready to serve our customer with utmost care and only the best quality products to ensure your satisfaction.</p>
