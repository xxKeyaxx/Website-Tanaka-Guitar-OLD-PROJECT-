# Website-Tanaka-Guitar-OLD-PROJECT-
A group project that I did for my second-semester university final project. It's simple and built with only pure HTML, CSS, and JS. It's about a fictional guitar store named Tanaka.

# How to Run
Just open any of the html files in the html folder and start exploring :)
